# How to build an interesting, fun, and educative class

1. __Set classroom’s objectives__
    * By making clear what you’re going to teach, students will learn better because they will be able to understand the direction the course will take.
1. __Build trust and an interactive environment__
    * Simple things can build trust between you and the students. If you respect them, they respect you and they’ll feel more comfortable to ask questions or make remarks for example.  One (quite) easy thing to do is remembering the names of the students and trying to pronounce them the correct way.
1. __Don’t forget to create moments to breathe and take breaks__
    * A very good way to make students remember what they do is doing what we call “formative assessments”. They are sort of mini exams you do during the process of learning – the goal is not to give a score but rather to evaluate whether or not what you taught is understood. This helps students solidify their knowledge and also take some distance from the learning.
1. __Specifics when teaching refugees__
    * If they have a degree from secondary school or university, some reflexes are automatic: taking notes, listening and writing at the same time… However, some behaviors are very cultural: asking questions, contradicting the teachers, applauding, standing before the teacher comes in, etc. Make sure to explain the rules of your course on the very first day of your teaching.  If they don’t have a degree or haven’t been to school very long, the rules you set at the beginning or even more important. It’s usually better to give handouts than asking to take notes, at least you’re sure everyone is on the same level in terms of what they bring home.

## EXAMPLE OF HOW A 1H LESSON CAN GO

Before, as preparation
### OBJECTIVES 

this is both for you to know where you’re heading and for the students
    * Learn the basics of HTML language
    * Identify what a coding language means

### MATERIALS 

it’s better to know what you need before starting a class so you can have a quick check before starting
    * Powerpoint called XYZ
    * Screenshots of what a page with only HTML language looks like
    * USB keys with Notepad++ where the students will save their work
    * Handouts with a step by step exercise on how to create a HTML page
    * Handout with all the websites that will be useful

Running the Class

(this cycle can be repeated multiple times per class, once per topic covered.  times should be adjusted according to the need of the material and class, but as a general rule try to keep explicit instruction shorter than guided practice)

### OPENING  – 10mn
It’s good to start with a fun activity or a video to watch so that students can mentally calm down before hard work begins
    * Play game XYZ to introduce everyone and yourself and try to remember the names of the students.

### EXPLICIT INSTRUCTION – 10mn
the traditional part of the class
    * Project slide 1 on the whiteboard and explain what HTML stands for – ask who heard the name before
    * Project slide 2 and explain the basic rules of coding – students should only listen at this point
    * …
    
### GUIDED PRACTICE  – 10mn
time to practice what they just learned in group
    * Write a line of code in front of everyone and make mistakes on purpose. Ask the students to correct you.

### INDIVIDUAL PRACTICE – 20mn
time to practice what they learned individually
    * Give handouts to each student: they have to follow the step by step instructions. Go around the students and offer your help, check if they’re going to the right direction.

### FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT – 10mn
this is the best way to check if someone is far behind
    * Start the Kahoot quiz. Stop after every question to give more explanation about the correct answer.
    * Download the results and give homework 1 to those who seem comfortable and homework 2 to those who seem a bit behind.

### CONCLUSION – 10mn
it’s very important to close a lesson and make sure everyone goes out on positive note
    * Quick recap of what the students learned today and announcement of what you will do next time, and what is needed from them to be able to follow the next lesson.
